\frametitle{Conclusion}
Progress continues towards a statistically rigorous fitting scheme for
simulating the hourglass correction. \\ 
\textbf{Remaining work:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fix the code transpostion bug for other half-scans
	\item Multiple collisions correction (maybe not neccessary if we're happy
		with it as a search parameter)
	\item Final luminosity calculations
\end{itemize}
\textbf{However:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Earned an Insight Data Science Fellowship, so:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Moving to the San Francisco for around 10 weeks
		\item Job interviews to follow
		\item Full time, intense program, so only a few hours per day available for
			PHENIX work 
		\item After I return, I will resume full time PHENIX work, hopefully with a
			job waiting at the end of summer, write thesis, etc.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

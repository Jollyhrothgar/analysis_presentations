  \begin{itemize}
    \item Previously, we found very poor convergence for scans after the first
      half-scan.We have solved this issue by a simple coordinate swap.

    \item We can now transform the rest of the scan steps similarly, running the
      root-finding algorithm we've discussed in past weeks.

    \item The results of these fits will provide us with several measurements of
      $\beta^*$, $\theta_{xing}$, and give us an estimate of $N_{mc}$.
  \end{itemize}

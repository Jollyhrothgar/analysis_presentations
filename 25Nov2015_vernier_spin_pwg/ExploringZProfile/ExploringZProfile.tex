\begin{frame}{Troubleshooting Steps}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Are profiles colliding at $z = 0$?
  \item How do the two sets of profiles compare? Maybe this gives some insight as
  to what makes the fit better/worse?
  \item Have we selected an appropriate interaction time?
  \item How do the "real profiles" compare to the "fake profiles" which match better?
  \item Is $\beta^{*}$ correction applied correctly to the width?
  \item Could binning be effecting the final profile?
  \item Are we looking up the right density in the z-profile distribution?
  \item Should the old model even be used as a bench-mark?
\end{itemize}

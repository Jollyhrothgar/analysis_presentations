\begin{frame}{Concluding Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Still some bugs to work out in the simulation, but not sure how to move
forward.
\item Simulation code has one-to-one correspondence between structures and
transformations between the models - the only difference is between the new
model, and old model, is the z-profile used.
\item Could it be that maybe nothing is wrong, and I just need to run over a
very large parameter space? It is somewhat distressing to not be able to get an
okay convergence by hand.
\end{itemize}

Thanks for the discussion!

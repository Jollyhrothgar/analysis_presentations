\begin{frame}{Status}
	\textbf{From last time:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initial trials with Data Derived Bunch z-profiles results in bad matching
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Could this be because bunch models are not overlapping at z = 0?
			\item Are Beam Profiles appropriately centered?
			\item It would be nice to determine, before exhaustive iteration, if
				these profiles are even viable (more on this later)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Can we improve performance with a simple lookup, as opposed to TGraph::Eval?
	\item Profiles might introduce artifacts resembling crossing angles/different
		values for $\beta^{*}$.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{To Do:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confirm that bunches are interacting over the right amount of time
	\item Confirm that new centering of the bunches results in beam overlap at
		z=0 occurs at the global maximum of the bunch profile
	\item Explore options for convergence with the new bunch profiles, compare
		to old profiles
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Progress}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Density lookup has been implemented, code now runs nice and fast
		\item Direct comparison between beam profiles from WCM data + simple model
			are ready - maybe this provides some insight?
		\item Studied bunch profiles - although all profiles line up relative to
			each-other, the maximum of the bunch profile was not centered.
		\item New method:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Find global maxima in WCM profile
				\item Build profile starting from the center, moving left and right
				\item Stop when we hit the edge of the data set
				\item The rest of the profile is set to "0"
				\item Possible option (to account for beam gas, peripheral bunch
					distributions in Z):
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Sample background of WCM profile, and fill the peripheral bunch
							distribution with random fluctuations based on sampled region
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Concluding Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Root finding via binary search seems to be yielding good results.
	Exhaustive iteration should not be necessary.
\item One-to-one correspondence with ZDC z-vertex distribution seems more
	straightforward in simple beam profile model, but this relationship is more
	complex with a more complex beam profile.
\end{itemize}

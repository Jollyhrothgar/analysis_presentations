  \begin{itemize}
    \item With tuning, we find that $\beta^*$ is within a reasonable range
      compared to the advertised value of 85, varying between 75 - 89. 
    \item With tuning, we find that $\theta_{xing}$ varied within its acceptable
      range of $\pm$2 milli-radians, ranging generally from -0.4 milli-radians
      to 0.4 milli-radians.
    \item Next up: a 500$GeV$ run for comparison.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Concluding Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Root finding via binary search seems to be yielding good results.
	Exhaustive iteration should not be necessary.
\item One-to-one correspondence with ZDC z-vertex distribution seems more
	straightforward in simple beam profile model, but this relationship is more
	complex with a more complex beam profile.
\item It seems problematic that $\beta^{*}$ appears to vary significantly with
	beam displacement. Is this a unphysical/a problem, or is it acceptable?
\item The simple beam profile model indicates no significant variance of
	$\beta^{*}$ with beam displacement, but the realistic profile model does.
\end{itemize}
